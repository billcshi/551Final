# Note For Dittrich11a

## NABC Overview

* Need: Since the Information and Communication Technology research(ICTR) collects and uses a lot of user-sensitive data, and ICTR may cause harm to users (including personal information leakage, computer system crashes, etc.), we need to provide a high-level guidance for the **ethical issues** of ICTR.
* Approach: The group of researchers proposed a high-level ethical principles guidance for ICT based on Belmont Report, which is a ethical guidance for biomedical and human behavioral science, they also show how this guidance can fit in ICT context and make a additional principle for ICT context.
  * Restatement of Belmont principles in ICTR context in Section B, and specifies each principle in Section C
  * Stakeholder in ICTR context:
    * The first step to deal with ethical issues is to understand every entities in ICTR context
    * **ICT Researcher**
    * **Human** Subject, Non-Subjects and ICT User: In ICTR, the target of research may be an information system or associated data, which complicates the assessment of potential harm to **users of that system or data**.
    * **Malicious Actor**: In ICTR context we not only focus on how the system run but also need to deal with malicious actor who might break the system and get sensitive data.
    * **Network/platform Owners and Providers**: Usually to get large amount of data, it is impractically asked every user for consent. **ISP might represent its user for informed consent**. but this approach should be managed carefully.
    * **Government with or without law enforcement**
    * **Society**: Typically refers ICT researcher society.
  * Frist Principle: **Respect for Person**
    * Individuals should be treated as autonomous agent, they accept the research volunteering
      * Leveraging intended benefits or **entice consent from subjects** **fails the voluntary** participation element of informed consent.
      * If it is impossible to ask every user, in some case can ask ISP or other **authorized entities to represent**.
      * Informed consent f**or one research purpose or use should not be considered valid for different research purpose**.
    * Persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection.
  * Second Principle: **Beneficence**
    * Beneficence doesn't mean make no harm and risk or make 100% benefit.
    * Beneficence means make a **balance between harm and risk**. However **evaluate a possible outcome is almost impossible**.
    * Researchers should anticipate such **worst-case scenarios** and make appropriate preparations to respond.
  * Third Principle: **Justice**, Fairness and Equity
    * Fairness should guide the initial **selection of the subjects**.
    * But Fairness **doesn't mean you cannot choose your experimental subject**. You can choose a better testbed.
  * Fourth Principle: **Respect for Law and Public Interest**
    * The Law issues are wide-range.
    * For Public interest:
      * The experiment should be **transparency**.
      * The experiment should be **accountability**.
* Benefit: Although the ICTR was not included in the supervision of authorized units at the time of publication, the ICT society still benefit from community-derived self-regulation by this report, especially in dealing with malicious actions that possible happen.  
* Challenge: Since this paper is still a guidance that the ICT researcher voluntarily adheres to, malicious actors (intentionally or unintentionally) can still maliciously attack other entities in the ICT context, regardless of the principles mention in this paper.

## For HW 1 Q2:

(a) HW1 Q2 Summary, primary paper [Dittrich11a]

(b) P43. [Dittrich11a] David Dittrich and Erin Kenneally (editors). The Menlo report: Ethical principles guiding information and communication technology research. Technical report, United States Department of Homeland Security, September 2011.

(c) <https://moodle.ant.isi.edu/pluginfile.php/4504/mod_folder/content/0/Dittrich11a.pdf?forcedownload=1>

(d) Key Idea: ICT research influences every human's daily life, but the ethical issues in the ICT context is beyond seriously discussed. This paper proposes four ethical principles guidance in the ICT context, mainly inspired by the Belmont Report in biotech context, and specifies how each principle work in ICT research.

(e) A novel of this paper: This paper firstly illustrates the ethical issues in ICTR(ICT research) context, reinterpretation the ethical principles from Belmont Report(Biotech context) to ICT context and specifies how each principle deal with these issues.

(f) The methodology this paper used is an idea. The author discusses the ethical topic in ICT context in high-level, provides his idea about how these issues can harm the entities in the ICT context and how these principles can defenses the (potential) issues.

(g) What is the best way the paper could be improved? Since this paper is a guideline, the author keeps talking about the issues at a high-level without any example. Adding some examples for each principle may improve the operative of this guidance. However, adding examples may also lead to the loss of neutrality for the guidelines of this paper.

(h) We talk about some network measurement paper in class, likes [Huang13a] for 4G LTE network and [Labovitz10c] for Inter-Domain structure. How do they deal with the ethical problem that uses an extremely large amount of data? For example, in [Laboviz10c], they used 200 EB of data(25% of whole world data at that time).

(i) Even though the experiment and the method are harmless for the ICT entities, some tool may be used in illegal proposes, for example using Tor for an illegal drug sale. Is it possible to design an ethical guideline to defense this kind of action?

(j) Deal with the question (h):

​            Using such a large amount of data means notifying every user is impractical.

​            In both articles, the researchers worked with ISPs and router company to obtain this data. Also, researchers have described how they desensitize these data.

​            Although they describe these processes, I am still uneasy about my Internet use. 

​            At the same time, when ISP signs a contract with the user(me), the user is usually required to agree to authorize the data to the ISP for so call academic analysis. According to this paper, this kind of contract violates ethical ICT research.

(k) I think this paper is super important. Since researchers are always willing to experiment with their wild ideas on the Internet and another ICT context, without ethical constraints, users will lose confidence in these network facilities and the associated experiments and may bring a lot of losses to users, including property damage and personal information leakage.

(I) Relate to almost all papers including a real-world experiment in this semester. For network measurement paper, likes [Huang13a] talks about how they carefully anonymize measurement data. For network probing paper, likes [Quan13a] carefully deal with the number of probes to be sent for not overloading the target network.

(m) Need: Since the Information and Communication Technology research(ICTR) collects and uses a lot of user-sensitive data, and ICTR may cause harm to users (including personal information leakage, computer system crashes, etc.), we need to provide high-level guidance for the ethical issues of ICTR.

(n) Approach: The group of researchers proposed a high-level ethical principles guidance for ICT based on Belmont Report, which is ethical guidance for biomedical and human behavioral science, they also show how this guidance can fit in ICT context and make an additional principle for ICT context.

(o) Benefit: Although the ICTR was not included in the supervision of authorized units at the time of publication, the ICT society still benefits from community-derived self-regulation by this report, especially in dealing with malicious actions that possibly happen. 

(p) Challenge: Since this paper is still a guidance that the ICT researcher voluntarily adheres to, malicious actors (intentionally or unintentionally) can still maliciously attack other entities in the ICT context, regardless of the principles mention in this paper.
