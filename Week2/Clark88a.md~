## Overview
1. Capture some early reasons which shaped the Internet protocols:
	* the idea of datagram(In Section 9)
	* layers seperation for TCP and IP(In Section 5)
	* original objectives of the Internet architecture(In Section 2)
	* the relation between goals and feature(In Section 3-7)
2. Some Basic Idea of Internet:
	* Datagram(In Section 9)
	* TCP(In Section 10)
	* Flow(Future Building Block, In Section 11)

## Fundamental Goal of Internet
1. effective technique for multiplexed utilization of existing interconnected network
2. Why package switching? Why no other technique, likes circuit switching?
3. The fundamental structure:
	* A packet switched communications(gateways) which implement a store and forward packet forwarding algorithm

## The Goal and related feature
7 goals which were established for Internet:
1. Survivability: 
	* solution: fate-sharing approach, only check at the endpoint
	* pro: protect anainst any number of intermediate failure, easier to engineer(for network)
	* con: hard to engineer(for host), not cost effective for retransmission
2. Multi-type of service:
	* different services have different requirments
	* solution: IP and TCP layers seperation
	* use datagram to be the building block of services
3. Varieties of networks:
	* minimum set of assumptions:
		* reasonable size
		* reasonable reliability
		* suitable form of addressing
4. Other 4 Goals(Not that important)
	* Distributed management: by exchange routing tables
	* Effitive: Not solve but reasonable not that bad
	* Attaching of new host: Become harder because of the solution of survivability

## Architecture and Implementation
1. The architecture tried hard not to constrain the range of service
2. Hard to guide the designer of realization of Internet:
	* Lack performance measure(Only on logic correct)
	* Lack Simulator

## Datagram
1. Why datagram?
	* eliminate the need for connection state
	* a basic building block for all kinds of services
2. Using datagram **Does Not** equal to high level service should be datagram, usually it is more complex

## TCP
1. Some of the early reasoning for the parts of TCP:
	* flow control by bytes:
		* original ARPANET: flow control based on both bytes and packets
		* TCP only use bytes:
			* permit the insertion of control into sequence
			* permit TCP packet to broken up
			* permit gathered small packet together
		* However,
			* acknowledged the control as well as data make the idea complex in practice
			* packet borken was moved to IP, and this make hard for IP protocol
			* The small packet problem may not happen if control by packet.
		* Maybe the original ARPANET approach is better.
	* EOL(End-Of-Letter flag):
		* the data up to this point in the stream was one or more complete application-level elements
		* EOL should be a tool for mappint the byte stream to the buffer management of the host

## Conclusion and Future Network
1. Resource Management and Accountability are difficult to achieve in context of datagrams
2. A better building block for Internet:
	* flow
	* gateway should have flow state to remember which flow are passing through them
	* flow state information would not be critical with service
	* the service would be enforced by end point
